InteractiveTest
===============

I was teaching a group of artists how to use LEDs in interactive 
artwork, and as one of my samples of things you could do, I had one 
of Adafruit's LED pixel strips. The comment I kept hearing was 
"Wow, those are pretty Christmas lights!"

I had to come up with something that would demonstrate to the average
person that these were controllable lights. Saying "individually 
addressable pixels" meant nothing to these guys.

So I made this interactive test.

How to use it
-------------

Before you download it, you will have to install the libraries and 
get your pixel strip hooked up properly. Just follow the instructions
here: http://learn.adafruit.com/12mm-led-pixels/overview

Once that is done, download the InteractiveTest code, and open it 
in the Arduino environment.

The number of pixels, the background color, and the moving pixel
color are all adjustable.
